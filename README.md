# DragonRuby_VisualNovel
Basic tools for VN and RPG dialogues and quest systems
Tools are currently NOT modular and implementing them in your project may require picking through my mess

<b>Currently Implemented:</b>



<i>Text boxes:</i> Prints Sprite UI elements to screen, including text box, name box, character portrait and larger background portrait

<i>Dialogue:</i> runs through a dialogue text file and prints the parsed information into the above/n

<b>Planned:</b>



<i>Descision Trees:</i> Ability to make Dialogue or action Choices. Requires <i>Event Flags</i>, and enchanced <i>Dialogue Parsing</i>.

<i>Dialogue Parsing:</i> Allow information for Desicions within the Dialogue files. Increase flexibility on message placement and content. Possibly have Dialogue expanded to Scenes, and thus requiring more complex commands preserved in the Dialogue files, such as <i>Jump</i> or setting certain <i>Event flags.</i>

<i>Main Menu:</i>Start of Game UI, with Options for New Game, Continue Game, Settings, and Credits

<i>Game Saves:</i>Preserve player progress and choices. Load and Save fuctions.

<i>Modularity: </i> Turn into proper Modules for easy use

<i>Instructions and Demo:</i> Explainations for easy use and elaboration



<b>Dreamed:</b>



The core elements above also provide foundational utitilty for 2D RPGs. Once finished with the Elements Essential to a Visual Novel, the repo will be cloned and then expanded to include such things as Background Grids, Player Movement, Shops and Inventory, Expanded UI functionality, and Animations
